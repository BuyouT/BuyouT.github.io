## Introduction

This portfolio website I based it of on a template by Bradly Schlenker, after I cloned his repository I modified the website, removed, added, and changed some other stuff.

## Usage

Clone. Modify HTML and CSS to your desire. Just like I did you can do it too!

## Contributing

Nah, don't bother. I don't need contributions unless you got something really cool to mention or you noticed a bug.
